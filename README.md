# redditBot
_Def__Bot_ was created to make me laugh. Its only job is to collect comments as they are submitted and *correct* already correct spellings of the word definitely.

#Usage
- ```pip install praw```
- Navigate to https://www.reddit.com
- Create account for your bot or just use your account. 
- Navigate to  preferences
- Click 'Apps'
- Create new script app
- Replace my Client ID and Secret Key
- Run Bot with ```python reply_post.py```


Please fork and make this cool!
